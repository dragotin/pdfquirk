PDF Quirk is a little utility to create PDFs from image files on the harddisk or from the scanner.

It utilizes the reliable and widely available tools `convert` from Imagemagick and `scanimage` from the SANE project, the standard scan solution on Linux.

PDF Quirk is free software. Contributions are very welcome.
